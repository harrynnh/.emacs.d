# My personal emacs config
This configuration is based on the Emacs from scratch series by System Crafters. The config sets up an environment to work with R, Python, and plain text writing in org-mode.
Previously I used Emacs Starter Kit for the Social Sciences and then Purcell Emacs config. Both are amazing. The reason I switch to this is because sometimes a certain functionality breaks for an unkown reason (mostly my fault) & having lots of functionalities in the start-kits makes it hard for me to fix them.
